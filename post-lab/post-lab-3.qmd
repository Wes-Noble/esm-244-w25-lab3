## Data Load

```{r}
#import data from this website

wine_quality <- readr::read_delim("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv",delim=';')
 
```


## Design a research question

Examine the data to come up with an interesting research question based on the wine data. It is a large collection of wine attributes and quality ratings to indicate the sommlier's rating of the wine.

## Explore the data

Create some exploratory tables or charts to help you better understand possible relationships

## Use a Tidymodel framework to conduct your analysis.

```{r}
wine_df <- wine_quality %>%
  #mutate(quality = factor(survived),   ### categorical outcome variables need to be factors
  #       pclass   = factor(pclass)) %>% ### turn some predictors to factor
  #select(-cabin, -ticket) ### lots of NAs here - and not likely to be very helpful

#surv_df |>
 # group_by(survived) %>%
 # summarize(n = n()) %>%
 # ungroup() %>%
  #mutate(prop = n / sum(n))
```
